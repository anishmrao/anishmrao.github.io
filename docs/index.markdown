# Experience

## Curium (Early-stage sensing applications startup), Singapore
**Machine Learning Engineer Feb 2023 - Present**
- Spearheaded the development of a 3D point cloud based Object Detection network for Human Sensing from overhead LiDAR sensors and
achieved an Average Precision of 0.85
- Optimized the model for real-time performance on an embedded system using quantization, pruning, and conversion to TensorRT, resulting in
a 15% speed-up in inference time
- Set up MLOps pipelines on AWS for model training, evaluation and deployment on edge devices

## Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore
**Student Attachment Nov 2022 - May 2023**
- Developed a soft probability based ensembling technique for cross-subject Motor Imagery decoding from EEG signals for non-invasive
Brain-Computer Interfaces. Achieved a 2% increase in average accuracy over subject-specific models
- Built an open-source toolbox to train and evaluate Neural Networks for EEG decoding, enabling easy config-driven and reproducible
experiments - LINK

## Intuit Bangalore, India
**Software Engineer II Jan 2020 - Jul 2022**
- Designed React components for customer marketing on the TurboTax frontpage and conducted A/B testing to increase user sign-ups by 20%
during my tenure
- Designed and implemented a highly scalable and available GraphQL API for user review caching and display, serving over 100M monthly
users
- Implemented data ingestion pipelines using JavaScript and Spring Boot to train ML models for user experience personalization through
collaborative filtering

## Indian Academy of Sciences Hyderabad, India
**Summer Research Fellowship Jun 2019 - Aug 2019**
- Extracted handwritten Telugu characters using connected-components based segmentation to produce the most extensive dataset for offline
handwritten Telugu characters
- Developed a CNN with an Attention-based LSTM decoder for handwritten character recognition, achieving a 9% increase in accuracy
compared to vanilla CNN models. This work was published in an IEEE conference - LINK

## JNResearch (Early-stage fintech startup) Bangalore, India
**Research Intern Jun 2018 - Aug 2018**
- Trained and tested a robust Region Proposal Network for a Faster R-CNN model for word segmentation on printed documents, used for invoice
processing and achieved 98% recall on unseen invoices
- Built a data augmentation pipeline for Optical Character Recognition by adding different types of noise, skew, jitter, etc using OpenCV in
Python
